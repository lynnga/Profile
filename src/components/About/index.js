    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm young person trying to find my way into the world.<br/>I recently went to six month bootcamp at SMU.<br/> This was an intensive program during this six months I learned what some people study years in college doing.<br/>
    I have learned everything from designing websites to building apps. Would I say that I am a pro defiently not. <br/> But is anyone a pro after 6 months? <br/> I feel that i have alot more to learn and I am exicited to keep on learning and hopefully be able to make a career for my self.<br/>Feel free to check out my full resume to get to know more about me!
